286603 (of 286603) markers to be included from [ adhd-parsed.map ]
Warning, found 46 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
Writing list of these individuals to [ adhd-parsed-geno.nosex ]
46 individuals read from [ adhd-parsed.ped ] 
46 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
23 cases, 23 controls and 0 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 46 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 286603 SNPs
46 founders and 0 non-founders found
39278 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ adhd-parsed-geno.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is nan
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 286603 SNPs
After filtering, 23 cases, 23 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 46 of unspecified sex
