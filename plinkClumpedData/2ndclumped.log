Writing this text to log file [ 2ndclumped.log ]
Analysis started: Sun Dec 13 16:21:32 2015

Options in effect:
	--file adhd-parsed
	--clump plinkassoc-assoc.assoc
	--out 2ndclumped

286603 (of 286603) markers to be included from [ adhd-parsed.map ]
Warning, found 46 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
These individuals will be set to missing ( or use --allow-no-sex )
Writing list of these individuals to [ 2ndclumped.nosex ]
46 individuals read from [ adhd-parsed.ped ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 46 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 46 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 286603 SNPs
46 founders and 0 non-founders found
39278 SNPs with no founder genotypes observed
Warning, MAF set to 0 for these SNPs (see --nonfounders)
Writing list of these SNPs to [ 2ndclumped.nof ]
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is nan
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 286603 SNPs
After filtering, 0 cases, 0 controls and 46 missing
After filtering, 0 males, 0 females, and 46 of unspecified sex

Parameters for --clump:
          p-value threshold for index SNPs = 0.0001
      Physical (kb) threshold for clumping = 250
     LD (r-squared) threshold for clumping = 0.5
        p-value threshold for clumped SNPs = 0.01
